# Accessing the SIH GPU Cluster

Early access to the GPU Cluster is now available. Please follow instructions on [this page](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/3579674625/GPU+Cluster#Sydney-GPU-Cluster---Early-access-available) to submit your request.


Information that you will be asked to provide in the access request form includes:

- **DashR Research Project Shortcode**: Please log in to the [DashR portal](https://dashr.sydney.edu.au/projects), click on the project you intend to work on, and locate the *Project Short Code*. This is essential for linking your compute usage to the correct research allocation.
- **Billing Code**: This should be the internal billing code associated with your project or department. If you are unsure, please consult your supervisor or finance administrator.

You will receive an email confirmation once your access has been granted, along with the project code and further instructions on how to connect to the SIH GPU Cluster.

**Work in Progress**: Long term project provisioning and access to the SIH GPU Cluster will be streamlined and directly managed on the university's [Researcher Dashboard (DashR)](https://dashr.sydney.edu.au/).
