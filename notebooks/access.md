# Accessing the SIH GPU Cluster

For early acccess to the SIH GPU Cluster, please directly contact the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html) with the following information:

- **DashR Research Project Shortcode**: Please log in to the [DashR portal](https://dashr.sydney.edu.au/projects), click on the project you intend to work on, and locate the *Project Short Code*. This is essential for linking your compute usage to the correct research allocation.
- **Billing Code**: This should be the internal billing code associated with your project or department. If you are unsure, please consult your supervisor or finance administrator.
