# Introduction to the SIH GPU Cluster

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) GPU Cluster is a high-performance research compute platform designed to accelerate AI workflows, scientific modelling, image processing, and other GPU-intensive research across the University of Sydney. This cluster is built with three NVIDIA DGX H200 nodes (24 H200 GPUs in total), high-speed InfiniBand networking, and 1 PB DDN EXAScaler parallel filesystem for fast shared storage.

More information about the SIH GPU Cluster can be found on the [Sydney Informatics Hub's Research Computing page](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/3579674625/SIH+GPU+Cluster).
