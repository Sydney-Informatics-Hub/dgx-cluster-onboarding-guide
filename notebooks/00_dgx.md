# Introduction to the DGX Cluster

The DGX Cluster is a high-performance computing (HPC) platform designed to accelerate AI and machine learning workloads. It is built on NVIDIA's DGX systems, which are purpose-built for deep learning and AI research. The cluster provides researchers with access to powerful GPUs, high-speed networking, and a robust software stack to facilitate development in AI research and scientific simulations.

More information about the DGX Cluster can be found on the [Sydney Informatics Hub's Research Computing page](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/3579674625/SIH+GPU+Cluster).
